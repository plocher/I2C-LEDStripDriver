I2C LED Strip Driver based on a PCA9685 

The PCA9685 is an I2C-bus controlled 16-channel LED controller optimized for Red/Green/Blue/Amber (RGBA) color backlighting applications.
Each LED output has its own 12-bit resolution (4096 steps) fixed frequency individual PWM controller


This design drives 2x RGB LED strips and 2x "white" strips - one set for backdrop lighting (dawn and dusk sunsets...) and the other for overhead (sunlight) valence illumination.
